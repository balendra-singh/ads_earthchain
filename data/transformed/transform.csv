The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the project is the use of very inefficient traditional cookstoves, consuming a lot of non-renewable charcoal and firewood. The high biomass consumption has negative impacts on the environment leading to deforestation and land degradation, Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) emissions, loss of soil fertility and soils’ reduced ability of water retention. Further, indoor air pollution through health-damaging pollutants while combusting firewood and charcoal result in diseases like e.g. pneumonia, stroke, ischaemic heart diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and lung cancer.

The African Stove Company Ltd. (TASC) is the coordinating/managing entity (CME) of the PoA and is the sole implementer of the VPA. TASC’s mission is financing and developing high-impact climate mitigation projects. 
 
The VPA is an activity that was originally anticipated to be included as a CPA under a CDM PoA (6864: Fuel Efficient Stoves in Africa ) and is now transitioning from the CDM to the Gold Standard under the PoA GS11009: TASC Clean Cooking PoA. The VPA is therefore retroactive in nature, as the first ICS was distributed in Zambia on 26th August 2020. 

The VPA is implemented in communities Zambia where woodfuel is the primary source of energy for cooking and open, 3-stone fires are commonplace. 

The project ICS combust biomass fuels more efficiently, reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and particulate emissions (PM), thus improving the indoor air quality in project households. Due to the higher thermal efficiency of the ICS relative to the 3-stone fires, the ICS reduce the amount of non-renewable biomass fuel required for meeting similar thermal energy needs.

In the absence of the proposed VPA, inefficient 3-stone fires are used for cooking and their replacement with project ICS reduces non-renewable biomass fuel consumption, saving greenhouse gas emissions.

At the time of VPA inclusion, there are 45,000 ICS planned for distribution under the VPA, of which c. 35,000 have been distributed and entered into the monitoring database.

Most families in Uganda cook with traditional inefficient cookstoves that consume large amounts of wood-based fuels (firewood or charcoal). This project is targeting the urban and peri-urban context of Northern and Eastern Regions of Uganda, where families tend to use charcoal as the main cooking fuel despite the fact that the price of charcoal has increased over time. The production of charcoal is increasing the rate of deforestation and land degradation, and their combustion is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change. In addition to the environmental consequences, there are serious health implications related with the inefficient cooking methods through the exposure on the smoke and other emissions. The project will address the challenges above by reducing the consume of charcoal during the cooking activities. Besides reducing greenhouse gas emission and contributing to climate change mitigation in line with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal number 13 (“Climate Action”), the project activities are foreseen to contribute also other sustainable development goals.",Gold Standard for the Global Goals,7539,2021-03-03,2026-03-02,GS TPDDTEC v3.1,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Micro Scale,11041,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2310,Carbonsink (Carbonsink Group S.r.l.),Uganda,UG,,,VER,VPA,1019,5658,GS5658: PoA - Climate Finance for Sustainable Development,"[{'name': 'Goal 12: Responsible Production and Consumption', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 13: Climate Action', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}, {'name': 'Certified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'CER'}, {'name': 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'abbreviation': 'REC'}, {'name': 'Planned Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'PER'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 15: Life On Land', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 1: No Poverty', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Averted Disability Adjusted Life Year', 'abbreviation': 'ADALY'}]}]",5870.0,0.0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1825,0.0,0.0,AF

All 15,000  plants in the project are commissioned from April 2019 onwards. The biogas plants are primarily Deenbandhu model and KVIC model. The purpose of the project is to replace the commonly used inefficient wood fired mud stoves technology, with clean, sustainable and efficient biogas. 

Each household utilizes cattle dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water.  This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste. Further, residue from the bio digesters can be used as organic fertilizer and will improve soil fertility in rural areas. 
Project activity will contribute towards sustainable development by replacing firewood with biogas generated from the biodigesters.

Now, Fair Climate Fund (FCF), a Dutch organization based in Utrecht, The Netherlands in an agreement with tiipaalga association along with local communities/federation is developing 4 grouped VPAs (Voluntary Project Activities) that will cover the municipalities of Pô, Tiébélé and Gniaro in the Province of Nahouri and will seek inclusion under the registered gold standard PoA and later certify under Fairtrade Climate Standard. 
This VPA, being part of the 4 grouped VPAs, will be developed to implement clean, safe and energy efficient cooking stoves which will consume less firewood and reduce smoke in the cooking area. The project promotes the implementation improved cook stove which is a mud made 3 stones efficient woodstove “F3PA”. The improved cook stoves will replace traditional cooking stoves, which utilize firewood and charcoal. With this approach, the 4 VPAs will reach out to more than 10,000 households in the Province of Nahouri in Burkina Faso.
This project seeks to increase access of rural communities to improved cook stoves by implementing F3PA mud stoves and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Burkina Faso. The improved cook stoves or F3PA mud stoves will be made of a mixture of clay mud, straw, dung of a donkey or cow and water. The stove will be constructed by locally available, inexpensive materials and its size will be customized as per the size of corresponding family. The project implementation will be done by imparting training to the local women in the rural areas. The technical and operational skill will be developed at local level which provides knowledge at household level on how to use and maintain the improved cook stoves. The implementation also includes component of education on hygienic usage and on the threat of climate change and health hazards related to the old cooking system and inform on the health and environmental benefits of using such efficient cook stoves.

This new Law 13.09 was adopted in Morocco in March 2010 to promote large scale renewable electricity generation projects offering the possibility for private operators to produce electricity from renewable resources and to sell the generated electricity to a pool of clients.The baseline scenario is the supply of equivalent annual power output by the national electricity grid. The baseline scenario is the same as the scenario existing prior to the start of implementation of the project activity.The electrical energy produced by the project activity will substitute electricity currently supplied by the national grid managed by the public utility, Office National de l’Electricité et de l’Eau Potable (ONEE ), and thus result in the reduction of Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, mainly CO2, associated with the fossil fuel dominated power plants feeding the national grid.Using a new and renewable local source of energy, the proposed project will contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions, the decrease of the country’s energy dependence vis-à-vis the importation of fossil fuels and will directly and indirectly help create new jobs. As such, the project activity is expected to contribute to the development of wind energy in Morocco and hence to help achieve the objectives of Morocco’s national strategy for renewable energy development. Generally speaking, the project’s contribution to Morocco’s sustainable development can be summarized by the following benefits:•Diversification of the national supply of energy;•Project in line with the Moroccan government’s objectives to increase the use of renewable energy and reduce reliance on imported fossil fuels. The diversification of energy sources for electricity production is one of the objectives of the new Moroccan energy strategy with an objective of 20% of renewable energy capacity in the nation’s electricity production in 2012 and a targeted development of 2,000 MW of installed wind capacity by 2020 .•Local development of renewable energy usage;•Reduction of the country’s imports in hard currency by the use of wind power instead of electricity mainly currently produced from imported coal, oil products and natural gas;•Reduction of national GHG emissions in accordance with the objectives of the UNFCCC ;•Contribution to the development of national and foreign investments in the energy sector;•Clean technology transfer and local capacity building in wind electricity generation and optimal use of wind energy in a heavy industry ;•Increases local employment opportunities during the construction phase and subsequently for the project’s operation phase.

The firewood collection is also causing deforestation and land degradation. Firewood combustion is moreover a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions responsible for climate change. In addition to the environmental consequences, there are serious health implications related with the inefficient cooking methods through the exposure on the smoke and other emissions.

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",2.2,42222,2014-06-15,2015-06-14,AMS-II.G.

The Project has been reducing greenhouse gas emissions through its recycling glass waste activities by reducing the energy consumption that would otherwise be required for the production of glass products made of virgin material. The project activity is located in the industrial park in the north of Essen, city in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The output capacity of the glass recycling plant in Essen is 160.000 tons/year. The total GHG emission reductions for the 5 years crediting period (2020-2025) are estimated at 4,315 tCO2e. The annual average GHG emission estimation is 863 tCO2e. This energy efficiency project is reducing greenhouse gas emissions through a pre-cullet process with less carbon intensive processes using glass waste than the usually used in glass production plants using virgin raw inputs. The participants of the Project recognize that this project activity is a model for other similar glass recycling facilities in Europe, which deliver sustainable development, and it contributes also to the social development growth of local comunity through employment opportunities and technology impact. Therefore, the Project contributes to the achievemnt of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, such as Climate Action (SDG 13), Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), and Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12).",Gold Standard for the Global Goals,863,2019-01-01,2023-12-31,AMS-III.AJ.

TDBP is the sector leader with the responsibility of coordinating, facilitating and monitoring sector functions and supporting the technical, financial and institutional architecture necessary for development of the domestic biogas sector in Tanzania. The VPA is to be implemented based on private sector market oriented principles, but developing governmental support for a favourable regulatory and policy environment, as well as general buy-in promotion and extension. The emissions reductions achieved through the VPA will generate carbon credits, the revenue from which will be used to subsidise the biodigesters and biogas stoves, making them more affordable for use in households, SMEs and communities.
Apart from reducing emissions, the VPA will contribute to the sustainable development through reduction of deforestation and the need for artificial fertilizers, reduction of indoor air pollution and time spent obtaining biomass for cooking, increase of employment opportunities in the biogas industry and improvement of crop yields and diversity through use of bio-slurry produced by the digester.",2.2,108165,2014-07-01,2021-06-30,GS TPDDTEC v 2.,Biogas - Heat,Small Scale,2751,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/511,HIVOS Foundation,"Tanzania, United Republic of",TZ,1.0,29.0,VER,VPA,1639,2747,African Biogas Carbon Programme (ABC) PoA,"[{'name': 'Goal 5: Gender Equality', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Averted Disability Adjusted Life Year', 'abbreviation': 'ADALY'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 13: Climate Action', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}, {'name': 'Certified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'CER'}, {'name': 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'abbreviation': 'REC'}, {'name': 'Planned Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'PER'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 2: Zero Hunger', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth', 'issuable_products': []}]",142130.0,136573.0,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2556,96.09019911348766,3.7593974614040557,AF

The Project “Greentech’s Emissions Reductions from PET Recycling, Romania"", developed by Greentech – a member company of Green Group,  is the first project in Europe to apply PET waste frameworks through PET waste recycling, proactively reducing greenhouse gases emissions (GHGs) that would be otherwise required for the production of plastic products made of virgin inputs and accelerating progress towards many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s).
The total GHG emission reductions for the 10 years crediting period (2016-2025) are estimated at 453,800 t CO2. The estimated annual average GHG emissions reduction is 45,380 t CO2/year.
Furthermore, the project is in line with specific UN requirements because it contributes to local environmental sustainability, since recycling instead of using material from virgin inputs decreases the overall energy use, GHGs and environmental burden caused by natural resources extraction.
At the same time, PET waste recycling reduces the amount of waste to be disposed in the landfill. The project also contributes towards better working conditions and better revenue distribution to improve local and regional economic development, increases employment opportunities in the area; it contributes to the development of new technologies, to regional integration and connection with other sectors, and to a large extent to the local municipalities’ funds for social insurance, such as health and pension funds, and to local and social community development.",Gold Standard for the Global Goals,45380,2016-02-01,2026-01-31,AMS-III.AJ.

Each household utilizes cow dung to feed the digester for the production of biogas for cooking purpose and heating water. This leads to reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by displacing conventionally used non renewable biomass with renewable biogas. In addition, the hygienic conditions in the rural areas will be improved by an appropriate disposal of waste.

The project will be registered as VPA-2 under the PoA “Efficient cookstoves in Benin and Togo"".The project area includes more than 10,000 households for a total population of 114,012 inhabitants (2013 Census) in the municipalities of Toucountouna and Ouaké. These are areas with a large rural population mainly using wood-energy with traditional three stones cookstoves.More than 3,500 households will have the Wanrou efficient cookstoves, since this type of efficient cookstove has not encountered any socio-cultural adoption barriers in previous experiments in 58 villages in the department of Atacora. About 300 rural women will be trained and equipped as instructors for the construction of the Wanrou efficient cookstove in their villages and surroundings.The Wanrou efficient cookstoves represent an accessible solution to improve the energy efficiency of cooking and limit the overconsumption of wood-energy, and will gradually replace the traditional three stones cookstoves. By reducing the consumption of non-renewable biomass, the Wanrou efficient cookstoves will also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions while preserving forests, ecosystems and biodiversity. These efficient cookstoves are a solution currently deployed in the region by Eco-Benin to combat energy poverty and use the potential for the generation of carbon credits. The use of the Wanrou efficient cookstoves with smoke exhaust chimneys also reduces the number of cases of respiratory diseases, reduces the time spent by women and children to collect firewood, and creates local jobs through the construction of the Wanrou efficient coosktoves. In addition to the promotion of the Wanrou stoves the project will deploy at least 8 solar kiosks and foresee 100 Wanrou cookstoves with a thermal electric generator which will allow to charge a mobile phone and/or LED lamp.

It’s been a 10-year journey for Impact Carbon and its stove manufacturer partners, from bilateral support for pilot projects, to project scale-up with key partnership, to project maturity and independence – all which have helped create a thriving improved cookstove market in Uganda. Carbon revenues fund 100% of the Program and are used to support Impact Carbon’s manufacturer partners to grow their businesses. Capital investments have been provided for tools and machinery that streamline production and increase the efficiency of the stoves. These investments have been coupled with best-practice guidelines and hands-on technical assistance, which ensure they can meet demand without compromising quality or efficiency. Moreover, the project is now prioritizing demand for improved cookstoves by deploying large-scale radio mass media campaigns to deliver simple and clear messaging around the benefits of purchasing and owning an improved cookstove, mainly around reduced cooking times, lower charcoal usage and significant cost savings (as much as 50% less charcoal needed which can result in over USD$110 of savings per year).

Its energy efficient stand-alone project activity registered with the Clean Development Mechanism and the Gold Standard is capable of bringing a cleaner, healthier and environmentally friendly technology to low-income individuals, especially women and children, by changing the traditional cooking practices used in schools in Uganda. Simoshi outsources institutional improved cook stoves (IICS) from the local manufacturer Ugastove and promotes and sells them to schools and institutions. The behavioural transformation Simoshi brings to schools through an effective management of change and subsequent support to the continuous use of the IICS enables both the participating schools and Simoshi to recycle a percentage of the stream of carbon credit returns, to further expand the number of schools that move up in the energy ladder.
Simoshi sells the IICS through payment schemes that include instalment modalities, allowing schools to comfortably pay back their debt throughout the school year, using the money saved from firewood NOT consumed to pay back for the acquired IICS. 
Simoshi's strong relationship of trust built with schools through monitoring, on-going staff training and free annual IICS maintenance, are the added on value and innovative project's pillars necessary for the behavioural transition to happen. IICS is a product that is prone to rapid deterioration if not maintained regularly. Nevertheless the annual free service provided to the IICS and the school is crucial in shaping future customer relations, product expectations and ultimately behavioural change. Schools face tremendous financial constrains and attention to the kitchen environment is the least of their priorities.

The power plant is expected to generate a net energy output of 27.638 GWh per year, estimated on the basis of long-term average wind speeds at the location. Electricity produced is sold to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the national electricity utility, through a dedicated transmission line. The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri.

Excess electricity is supplied to the grid.The main purpose of the project is to transform the existing low tech sludge treatment processat Kubratovo into a modern advanced treatment process matching the best sludge treatmentpractice available in Western Europe. This transformation has a major effect on the environmentthrough dramatically reducing the existing methane gas emissions at the plant while alsoreducing the volume of sludge (to as much as 50%) that needs to be transported, hencereducing GHG emissions from transportation as well (not included in GHG abatementcalculations).The overall objective of the project is to provide an environmentally friendly sludge treatmentprocess reducing methane and carbon dioxide emissions that – under a business-as-usualscenario – would have continued.Other objectives are:• replace the traditional sludge drying beds and landfill options with mesophilic digestion ofall primary and secondary sludge followed by mechanical dewatering in order to reduceGHG emissions;• effectively mitigate odour problems from the existing treatment of sludge and sludgeliquors through introduction of digestion;• production of fertiliser by mechanical dewatering of the digested stabilised sludge;• production of electricity from utilisation of the biogas in CHP gas engines therebyreducing GHG emissions from electricity production by the grid.The project delivers the following key results:• all primary and secondary sludge thickened and digested as per EU recommendationsand guidelines;• all biogas produced within the digestion process used for power and heat generation viaCHP gas engines thus reducing on-site electricity purchases from the national grid;reduction in on-site fossil fuel usage as all site-heating requirements will be met by theCHP gas engines;• all sludge is stabilised and pathogen free.Long term strategic reductions of GHG emissions include:• reduction in open release of CH4 from open anaerobic sludge tanks and drying beds;• reduction in open release of CH4 from landfill disposal site;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of electricity production from fossil fuels;• reduction in CO2 emissions due to replacement of heat generation from fossil fuels.The project had been implemented in two stages:- Erection of a new digester system consisting of 4 digesters, 7,000 m3 each, designed,supplied and erected by PASSAVANT ROEDIGER Anlagenbau.For destroying of the excess methane in case of emergency a flaring system have beenimplemented, consisting of 2 x DN150 flares, type ZA1-F2-0/N0 designed andmanufactured by HEGWEIN GmbH, Germany.- Erection of 3 new co-generation sets GE JMS 320 GS-B.LC with 1,063 kW electriccapacity each and 1,088 kW thermal capacity, for generation of electric and thermalenergy by combusting biogas from digesters.The digesters were commissioned at the end of 2006 and started operation on 01 January 2007but due to some technical problems in the adjustment of the biological process the generation ofbiogas was interrupted in the end of June 2007 and resumed on 01 May 2008, so the firstindustrial quantities of biogas were registered in May, 2008.The CHP was commissioned and started generating electricity and thermal energy for plant’sneeds in November, 2009.",Gold Standard for the Global Goals,61769,2021-04-01,2028-03-31,AMS-I.C.

The current cooking practice in Bangladesh is the use of “three-stone"" cooking stove, popularly known as traditional stoves. Biomass serves for 90% of Bangladeshi households’ energy needs . Around 95% of rural population uses biomass fuel for cooking with fuelwood being used in around 85% households . 98% of Bangladesh’s rural population cooks with biomass using traditional stoves, despite years of efforts by governments and health organizations to promote models that are fuel-efficient and have chimneys . The VPA stoves burn fuel more efficiently and are designed to draw off smoke and toxins, thus creating cleaner indoor air for women and children. They have also been shown to use about 50% less fuel to cook the same amount of food.  In the absence of this VPA households would cook primarily using traditional inefficient stoves, perpetuating environmental and health degradation.

The project involves the capture of biogas from the pig farm’s wastewater treatment facility and the construction of a biogas generation plant to utilize the recovered biogas for electricity production. The project also involves the installation of wind turbines and solar PV. Currently, the biogas generation plant has an installed capacity of 65KW with another 195kw to be installed, for an installed capacity of 260KW. Currently, the solar PV system has an installed capacity of 963KW with another 490KW to be installed, for an installed capacity of 1,453KW.

Thus, the current installed renewable energy capacity is 1,028KW and the future total installed capacity will be 1,764KW. The completed project will produce an estimated 3,776MWh annually. Social and Environmental Benefits(1) Reduced methane emissions – Methane-rich biogas is a byproduct of waste decomposition. In the absence of the project, GHG emissions in the form of methane would be released directly into the atmosphere. The project will prevent methane emissions by capturing the biogas associated with pig waste treatment.

A total capacity of 2.80 MW will be installed, composed by 2 engines with individual capacity of 1.4 MW each. The project is expected to export 354,968  MWh during its lifetime.Uberlândia Landfill comprises two adjoining solid waste disposal sites (SWDS), named Landfill I and Landfill II, both owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. (Project Participant). The Landfill I started operating in July of 1995 and stopped receiving waste in September 2010. The Landfill II started operating in October 2010 with the same environmental care applied to the previous disposal site and counts on a qualified and multidisciplinary team of technicians. The landfill has a total area of 300,000 m2, with 200,000 m2 dedicated to disposal of waste, being able to receive till 4,500,000 m3 of solid waste for an approximately 18 years of lifetime. All the area was sealed with a membrane of High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and compacted clay in order to protect the phreatic layer from contamination. The leachate generated in each landfill is given a different treatment. For Landfill I the leachate is treated at an ascendant flow anaerobic reactor followed by an anaerobic filter and then sent to the Uberabinha’s sewage treatment station (ETE Uberabinha) through municipal canalization. The leachate from Landfill II, after being analysed by the Municipal Department of Water and Sewage (Departamento Municipal de Água e Esgoto – DMAE), was authorized to be directly sent to the ETE Uberabinha without previous treatment. In this Project the Landfill I and the Landfill II were considered as a sole SDWS, since the area surrounding the two sites, including them, is owned and operated by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and they are physically near enough to permit the joint operation. In fact, only a 27 m width road used exclusively for the landfilling operation separates the two sites, and the gas station and power plant of the proposed project activity are planned to be installed on the roadside between the Landfill I and Landfill II. Therefore, the estimative of emissions of methane from SWDS considered the two sites as one single SWDS.The scenario existing prior to the implementation of the Uberlândia landfills I and II project activity at the Uberlândia Landfill is the operation of the landfill with uncontrolled emission of the LFG (landfill gas) generated to the atmosphere, i.e. the LFG generated due to the decomposition of the organic matter is vented through the vertical wells installed at the landfill’s area. As will be demonstrated ahead, the existing scenario and the baseline scenario are the same.Emissions associated with the baseline scenario are the CH4 emissions due to the atmospheric release of the LFG and CO2 emissions due to the power generation from fossil-fuel power-plants. With the implementation of the project, the LFG previously released will be collected through the installation of pipelines and emission reduction will be achieved through the destruction of the gas collected in a flaring system and in the power plant. Additionally, the project will export renewable electricity to the grid, avoiding the dispatch of the same amount of electricity from fossil-fuel based power plants in the Brazilian National Grid.The project will bring benefits to sustainable development, as follows:-Increase of local environmental quality: the project will contribute not only through the avoidance of GHG emissions to the atmosphere, but also by displacing the fossil fuel consumption from power plants connected to the Brazilian Electric Grid. The project might also be seen as a good practice of correct solid waste final disposal;-Labour capaciting / Income generation: the project will need qualified operators to maintain the gas collection wells and pipeline and to operate the degassing station and the power plant. A team composed by engineers and technicians will be created and trained by international consultants and manufacturers. The revenues of these personnel will be above the market, as the technology employed is new in the Uberlândia region;-Integration with different sectors: using LFG to generate electricity is relatively new in Brazil – some projects were developed only under the CDM and only a few of them are indeed generating electricity (like the Bandeirantes Landfill Gas to Energy Project, São João Landfill Gas to Energy Project and Exploitation of the biogas from Controlled Landfill in Solid Waste Management Central – CTRS / BR.040). Therefore, the project will have an enormous contribution over the integration with the electric sectors.Project start date: 03/05/2011This is the date of creation of Energas Geração de Energia Ltda., composed by Limpebrás Resíduos Ltda. and Asja Brasil Serviços para o Meio Ambiente Ltda. exclusively for the development of the Project.",Gold Standard for the Global Goals,141878,2019-09-04,2026-09-03,ACM0001 Flaring or use of landfill gas,Biogas - Electricity,Large Scale,3434,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/614,Energas Geracao de Energia Ltda,Brazil,BR,18.8783,48.3185,GS CER,Standalone,,,,"[{'name': 'Goal 13: Climate Action', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}, {'name': 'Certified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'CER'}, {'name': 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'abbreviation': 'REC'}, {'name': 'Planned Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'PER'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Averted Disability Adjusted Life Year', 'abbreviation': 'ADALY'}]}]",296166.0,281166.0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2556,94.93527278620773,3.7142125503211165,SA

The Project has been designated by the Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) and Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as a Small Power Project (SPP), and its operations and sale of electricity are governed by the Permit issued by SLSEA, and the standardised Small Power Purchase Agreement (SPPA) signed with CEB. The Permit was issued and the SPPA was executed, before the commencement of construction activities. The SPPA is a standardised, 20-year, non-negotiable contract, and defines a standardised tariff for the sale of electricity on the basis of a generic wind power plant and other financial indices at the time of calculating the tariff by the Authority (SLSEA). This project is the first wind power project in Sri Lanka. The energy generated by the project is to be supplied to the sole purchaser of electricity in the country, the Ceylon Electricity Board. The metering of the generation will take place at the panel room of the project, where all eight WTGs will be connected. The metering of the project is done by the CEB, and at the commissioning of the project, the officials from the CEB will connect the meters for the metering. The project activity reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the following manner. The wind resource potential is converted to electricity using eight wind turbines and electricity is supplied to the national grid, which is fully owned and managed by CEB. Sri Lanka’s electricity generating system feeding the national grid is dominated by thermal power plants, using diesel, fuel oil and naphtha, and is also using coal from year 2011. A range of diesel engines, open cycle gas turbines and combined cycle gas turbines serve the grid, while the first coal-fired power plant in Sri Lanka commenced operation in March 2011 at a site adjacent to this small scale CDM project activity. Energy share in the national grid from fossil-fuelled thermal power plants was 60% in 2007, and is expected to exceed 80% by year 2020. Electricity generated from the Mampuri Wind Power Plant displaces a corresponding portion of fossil fuels used in power plants serving the national grid and avoids the corresponding greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and coal power plants. The Mampuri Wind Power Plant is estimated to displace 18,768 tCO2 per year at an emission factor of 0.6791 kgCO2 per kWh, as calculated later in this PDD. It also avoids other emissions such as SOx and NOx from thermal power plants located throughout Sri Lanka. The project activity has improved the road along the coast at Mampuri, which has enhanced the mobility of villagers in Mampuri. Several community service initiatives are being implemented by the project participant. Estimated project start date: 23/08/2008",2.2,18768,2013-01-01,2022-12-31,AMS-I.D.

Such stoves are considered non-efficient and require large amount of charcoal to operate which translate into a significant cost for the user. More than 1.4 million tons of charcoal is this way used each year.  This  over-consumption  is  not  sustainable  and  is  an  important  reason  behind  the  acute deforestation and soil erosion problems found in this country. On top of that, emissions of greenhouse gas resulting from the burning of charcoal, significantly participate to the global problem that is climate change. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called PALMIS Enèji with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all.  This  program  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distribute  more  efficient  charcoal cookstoves,  LGP  cookstoves  and  solar  lanterns.  PALMIS Enèji is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. A new microcredit financial product is also  being  developed  with  the  support  of  ID  Microfinance  (a  local  microfinance  institution  and  also  a program  of  Entrepreneurs  du  Monde)  to  help  people  with  limited  financial  means  to  have  to  access  to those products. Finally, PALMIS Enèji is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as much as possible energy products in Haiti. The project activity  “Expanding LPG access in Haiti through microfinance services""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  charcoal  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas.

The baseline scenario was identified using data from a large scale national survey published by the  United Nations Comisión Económica para América Latina y el Caribe (UN-CEPAL), report titled Consumo de Leña en Honduras (April 2011).  This report shows that on average 69% of interviewed households used firewood as input for cooking food, and over 60% of baseline stove models are traditional designs that use woodfuel.  This SSC-CPA aims to provide both climate and livelihood benefits to the large population of Honduran households currently using inefficient biomass burning stoves.Several greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide, are produced as a result of the combustion of non-renewable biomass as used in cooking stoves.  ICS improve heat transfer efficiency as compared to the baseline conventional stoves, thereby reducing both the amount of wood fuel used by unit appliance implemented and the emission of GHGs.  In addition to direct climate benefits, this SSC-CPA achieves several co-benefits that contribute to sustainable development:Environmental BenefitsThe project reduces the demand for biomass required for cooking stoves thus reducing the rate of deforestation connected to wood consumption. In addition, the reduction in use of less efficient stoves will yield a reduction in emissions from fuel combustion thus improving air quality and reducing the emission of harmful gases that contribute to climate change.Social and economic benefitsProject beneficiaries using the ICS reduce their wood consumption. The reduction in fuel needs will also save project beneficiaries time and income. This means that biomass users who gather wood will see a reduction in the amount that they have to collect, leaving that time available for other activities. Biomass users that purchase their fuel will be able to direct more of their income to other needs.  From the economic perspective, the project will contribute to the scale-up of local businesses and organizations, with the potential to create jobs in retail, marketing and distribution.",v2.2 CASH,42222,2015-06-15,2020-06-14,AMS-II.G.

Around 30% of Lao population lacks access to a source of improved drinking water and are at risk of getting diarrhoea or other water borne diseases. Though, a significant fraction of Lao population treats water preferable by boiling using woody biomass, charcoal etc to make the water safe for drinking. There is a significant fraction of families even cannot afford firewood to boil water, hence are forced to continue to drink unsafe water.
TerraClear is a social enterprise, registered as a private limited company under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The enterprise is in the business of getting clean water to more people in Laos by selling the Lao Ceramic Water Purifier (CWP) to the population. CWP’s help people access safe drinking water, especially in rural areas, reduce time spent provisioning drinking water or collecting wood, reduce costs for families, reduce child and adult morbidity and mortality, improving attendance at school and increased productivity. Ceramic Water Purifiers provide for removal of microorganisms from water by gravity filtration through porous ceramics, with a typical flow rate at production of 1.5 - 3 litres per hour.  Originally TerraClear plans to sell over 100,000 CWP’s between 2012 and 2019 but this target seems a bit high as up to mid-2018, the total sale is just about 58,000 filters. It is estimated that by the end of its first crediting period (15th July 2019), the total sale would be about 67,000 CWPs.
 
With the new target, CWPs will provide safe drinking water for potentially more than 0.3 million people, and at the same time reduce the demand for water treatment through boiling water with non- renewable biomass. The CWP’s have a useful life of 5 years or more provided proper care and maintenance. The Lao Ceramic Water Purifiers are manufactured locally in Laos and therefore contribute to building a local industry and value added in Laos, as well as creating much needed sustainable jobs and business opportunities in rural areas. The project start date is 06/06/2012.  With the assistance of carbon finance, TerraClear can become a unique and on-going sustainable enterprise capable of providing emissions-free household water treatment options to rural households, and thereby improve public health, household welfare and economy, as well as contribute to reduced deforestation in Lao PDR.",Gold Standard for the Global Goals,33541,2019-07-16,2026-07-15,GS TPDDTEC v 1.,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Large Scale,2095,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/318,TerraClear Production Co.

The greater efficiency of an improved cook stove causes a reduction in the consumption of firewood and saves non-renewable biomass and emission of green house gases. ,Gold Standard for the Global Goals,8160,2013-01-01,2022-12-31,AMS-II.G.

Indeed, eighty-four (84) per cent of households use wood and charcoal on a daily basis. For that reason, there is a growing pressure on forests and the country currently looses 105,000 hectares of forested land every year according to the Ministry in charge of environmental issues (“Ministère de l’environnement et du développement durable""). High efficiency improved cookstoves and gas stoves help fight deforestation by significantly reducing the demand for wood and charcoal, and thus contribute to a global reduction in GHG emissions from biomass combustion. To deal with this issue, the French NGO Entrepreneurs du Monde launched a new program called Nafa Naana with the objective to facilitate access to cleaner, more modern and cheaper sources of energy for all. Nafa Naana takes place in the context of the National Plan for the Environment (PANE) established in 1991 by the Government of Burkina Faso, and is financially supported by the Ministry of Mines, Quarries and Energy. Nafa Naana  works  as  a  social  micro-franchise  that  distributes  more  efficient  charcoal and wood stoves,  LGP  stoves  and  solar  lanterns.  Nafa Naana is developing its own distribution network with the objective of making those products easily available to all. Financial services are offered to Nafa Naana clients either as group loans or individual loans to help  people  with  limited  financial  means  access those products. Finally, Nafa Naana is trying to increase the level of awareness in local populations about the described issues and the advantages of those products by creating communication tools tailored to the local context.  The  next  step  will  very  likely  be  the  creation  of  a  social  enterprise  in  order  to  assure  the sustainability of its social mission: to distribute as many energy products as possible in Burkina Faso. The project activity  “Expanding access to LPG in Burkina Faso through microfranchised distribution""  is in phase with this approach since  it aims to promote the use of LPG as a source  of  energy  for  cooking,  thus  limiting  the  usage  of  wood  and  thus  reducing  emissions  of greenhouse gas. Other  than  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions  and  helping  fight  deforestation,  this project  also  offers  the  possibility  to  reduce  the  emissions  of  toxic  fumes  such  as  carbon  monoxide and PM 2.5 inside the homes of the beneficiary population. Indeed, the combustion of wood with traditional stoves releases toxic fumes in the air. These toxic fumes are one of the main causes of respiratory diseases among women and children.  Finally,  the  use  of  LGP  cookstoves,  instead  of   traditional  ones,  means  that the  end  user  is  saving significant amounts of money because fuel expenses per gram of food cooked are lower for LPG than for wood when the wood is purchased by the user.",v2.2 CASH,8877,2016-04-30,2026-04-29,GS TPDDTEC v 2.,Energy Efficiency - Domestic,Micro Scale,1146,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/103,Entrepreneurs du Monde,Burkina Faso,BF,12.361466,-2.438965,VER,Standalone,,,,"[{'name': 'Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Averted Disability Adjusted Life Year', 'abbreviation': 'ADALY'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 13: Climate Action', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}, {'name': 'Certified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'CER'}, {'name': 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'abbreviation': 'REC'}, {'name': 'Planned Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'PER'}]}, {'name': 'Goal 15: Life On Land', 'issuable_products': []}]",30055.0,29803.0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3651,99.16153718183331,2.7160103309184693,AF

• InfraVest Fongwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 13.8 MW (6x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Hsinfong Township (therefore also called Hsinfong Wind Farm), Hsinchu County, which comprises 6 wind turbines (hereafter: Fongwei Wind Farm).
• InfraVest Longwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 44.1 MW (18x2.3 MW + 3x0.9 MW) onshore wind farm located in Houlong Township (therefore also called Houlong Wind Farm), Miaoli County, which comprises 21 wind turbines (hereafter: Longwei Wind Farm).
• InfraVest Chungwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 29.9 MW (13x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Dajia and Da-An Townships, Taichung County, which covers Taichung phases I and III, and Dafong sites, and which comprises 13 wind turbines (hereafter: Chungwei Wind Farm). There are another 20 wind turbines also located in Dajia and Da- An Townships, Taichung County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 20 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS472), which was already registered in 2010. Therefore, the 13 wind turbines in Chungwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS472).
• InfraVest Tauwei Wind Farm Project, Taiwan: a 4.6 MW (2x2.3 MW) onshore wind farm located in Guanyin Township (also called Hsinwu Wind Farm), Taoyuan County, which comprises 2 wind turbines (hereafter: Tauwei Wind Farm). There are another 19 wind turbines also located in Guanyin Township, Taoyuan County, which belong to the same project owner. But these 19 turbines belong to the project owner’s another GS VER project (GS612), which was already registered in 2011. Therefore, the 2 wind turbines in Tauwei Wind Farm under the project are the capacity addition to the existing grid-connected renewable power plant (project GS612).
The above-mentioned four wind farms are constructed and operated by InfraVest Wind Power Group (hereafter refer as “InfraVest”), which is a subsidiary of Germany based VWind AG. The project in total comprises 42 wind turbines and the total installed capacity of the bundled project is 92.4 MW. At full capacity, the aggregated output of the project is expected to be of 250,866 MWh/year, which is to be delivered to the state-owned power grid, Taipower grid (“TPG”), displacing part of the electricity supplied by the power grid currently dominated by fossil fuel-fired power plants. Accordingly, the project will lead to carbon dioxide emission reduction. The annual emission reductions are estimated as 190,908 tCO2e/year, and the total emission reductions for the first crediting period of 7 years are estimated as 1,336,356 tCO2e.",Gold Standard for the Global Goals,264960,2014-02-01,2021-01-31,ACM0002 Grid-connected electricity generation from renewable sources,Wind,Large Scale,1001,https://platform.sustain-cert.com/public-project/2,South Pole Carbon Asset Management Ltd.,"Taiwan, Province of China",TW,24.611389,120.736946,VER,Standalone,,,,"[{'name': 'Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 7: Affordable and Clean Energy', 'issuable_products': []}, {'name': 'Goal 13: Climate Action', 'issuable_products': [{'name': 'Verified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'VER'}, {'name': 'Certified Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'CER'}, {'name': 'Renewable Energy Certificate', 'abbreviation': 'REC'}, {'name': 'Planned Emission Reduction', 'abbreviation': 'PER'}]}]",976517.0,717765.0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2556,73.50256063130493,2.8756870356535575,AS
